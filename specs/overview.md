# Todo Full-Stack Web Application - Project Overview

## Project Description
This is a multi-user todo web application built with Next.js 16+ frontend, FastAPI backend, and Neon PostgreSQL database. The application enforces user ownership for all task operations and uses JWT authentication for security.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with SQLModel ORM
- **Database**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with JWT tokens
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), any Python-compatible host (backend)

## Core Features
1. User registration and authentication
2. JWT-based secure access
3. Task management (CRUD operations)
4. Task completion toggling
5. User ownership enforcement
6. Responsive UI design

## Tech Stack Compliance
This project follows the locked technology stack as mandated by the project constitution:
- Next.js 16+ (App Router only)
- FastAPI for backend
- SQLModel for ORM
- Neon PostgreSQL for database
- Better Auth for authentication
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Development Workflow
Following the spec-driven development approach:
1. Constitution defines project principles
2. Specification documents requirements
3. Planning creates implementation strategy
4. Tasks break down implementation
5. Implementation follows tasks precisely
